.. this file was added for https://github.com/INN/largo/issues/1713
   we're trying a ``docs/SUPPORT.rst` file to see if it triggers GitHub's automated support file detection

Largo has many forms of documentation.

- User documentation is available at `largo.inn.org <https://largo.inn.org>`_ and `support.inn.org <https://support.inn.org>`_
- Developer documentation is available at `largo.readthedocs.io <https://largo.readthedocs.io>`_.
- We're also available via email at `support@inn.org <mailto:support@inn.org>`_.
