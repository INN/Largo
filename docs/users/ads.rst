Supported Plugin: DoubleClick for WordPress
-------------------------------------------

Largo supports `DoubleClick for WordPress <https://dfw.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_. Simply install the plugin and follow the steps outlined `in the DoubleClick for WordPress <https://dfw.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ documentation.

You will neeed a `DoubleClick for Publishers`_ or `Google AdSense`_ account set up before you begin this process.

.. note:: If you use INN's hosted version of Largo you do not have the ability to install and activate plugins and will need to ask us to do this for you. Please `submit a service request <http://jira.inn.org/servicedesk/customer/portal/4>`_ and we'll be happy to help.

If your ads are not showing up, check that your ad widgets are set to be visible in **Dashboard > Widgets**. Try resizing your browser window to be wider or narrower.
