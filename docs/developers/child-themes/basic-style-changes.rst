Changing Basic Styling
----------------------

Largo has a built-in way to change some basic styling options.

To enable this option, from the *Appearance* > *Theme Options* screen click on the "Advanced" tab and check the box labelled "Enable Custom LESS to CSS For Theme Customization" and then save the settings.

You will now see an additional menu item under the Appearance menu labelled "CSS Variables". From this menu you will be able to change some basic styling attributes of your Largo site, including the color scheme, fonts and font-sizes.

This option is only intended for making some basic changes to your site's styles. For anything more complex you will need to create a child theme.
