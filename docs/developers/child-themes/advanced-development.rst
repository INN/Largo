Advanced Theme Development and Modification
-------------------------------------------

We've created a `Largo-Sample-Child-Theme repository <https://github.com/INN/Largo-Sample-Child-Theme>`_ to illustrate how we organize child themes that extend Largo.

Visit the repository page to learn more about the following as they pertain to Largo-based child themes:

- `Unit Tests and Continuous Integration <https://github.com/INN/Largo-Sample-Child-Theme/blob/master/tests/readme.md>`_
- `Stylesheets (LESS and CSS) <https://github.com/INN/Largo-Sample-Child-Theme/blob/master/less/readme.md>`_
- `Theme Directory Layout <https://github.com/INN/Largo-Sample-Child-Theme#theme-directory-structure>`_
- `Custom Theme Javascript or CSS <https://github.com/INN/Largo-Sample-Child-Theme#removing-or-replacing-largo-javascript-or-css>`_
- `Removing or replacing Largo Javascript or CSS <https://github.com/INN/Largo-Sample-Child-Theme#removing-or-replacing-largo-javascript-or-css>`_

You can also look at other themes we've made. These themes are nested in what we call Umbrella Repositories, which contain themes and related files in a framework allowing for deployment. A list of these Umbrella Repositories can be found `by searching for 'umbrella-' on INN's GitHub page <https://github.com/INN?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=umbrella-&type=&language=>`_. If you'd like to set up you own umbrella repo, see `our umbrella boilerplate <https://github.com/INN/umbrella-boilerplate>`_.
